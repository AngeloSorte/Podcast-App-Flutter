## Introduction

I have built a basic podcast app with an interactive UI, as well as some of its functionalities : 

* Like System
* Multi-word search system.

The app currently has 5 screens :

* Home: With a hard-coded list of podcasts and an integrated search field. The screen adapts automatically depending on whether the TextField is empty or not.
* Favorite: Displays liked podcasts and a button for each podcast to unlike it.
* Podcast: Displays information and the episodes list of a particular podcast.
* Episode: Displays information about the episode, a dynamic slider that changes the duration synchronously, and other non-functional UI Buttons (Inspired from an existing UI).
* About: Displays basic information about the app.
